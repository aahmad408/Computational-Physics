Collection of python computational physics simulations employing numerical methods to model various physics processes.

These were developed through the completion of a computational physics course using google colab.

The simulations were specifically involving the physics concepts of statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and relativity, and classical mechanics.

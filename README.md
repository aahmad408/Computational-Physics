Collection of python computational physics simulations employing numerical methods to model various physics processes.

These were developed throughout my undergraduate years as a physics major using Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or Visual Studio Code.

The simulations apply a myriad of concepts within statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, classical electromagnetism, classical mechanics, relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.
